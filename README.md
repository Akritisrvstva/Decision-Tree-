Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree

This repository contains an implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The Decision Tree algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, making it a powerful and interpretable tool for data analysis.

Introduction
The Decision Tree Classifier is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that partitions the input space into segments and assigns a class label to each segment. It works by recursively splitting the data based on the features that provide the best separation of the target variable classes. This process continues until a stopping criterion is reached, resulting in a tree-like structure where each leaf node represents a class label.

# Installation
To use the Decision Tree Classifier, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install this package using pip:

sql
Copy code
pip install decision-tree-classifier
Usage
To use the Decision Tree Classifier, import it into your Python code and follow these steps:

python
Copy code
from decision_tree_classifier import DecisionTreeClassifier

Create an instance of the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

Prepare your data: X (features) and y (target variable)
X_train, y_train = ...

Train the classifier on your data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

Make predictions on new data
X_test = ...
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
Example
Here's a simple example using the Decision Tree Classifier on a synthetic dataset:

python
Copy code
from decision_tree_classifier import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

Create a synthetic dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, random_state=42)

 Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

 Create an instance of the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

Train the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

 Make predictions on the test data
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

 Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
